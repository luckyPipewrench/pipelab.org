PipeLab started as a homelab. A server under a desk running a few containers, mostly for fun. It grew into a real lab — on-prem Kubernetes, GPU compute, AI agents managing a business, and an open-source security tool that caught the attention of the OWASP community.

I come from the trades. I run a plumbing company and I build software because the problems I hit running a real business don't have off-the-shelf solutions. Nobody taught me this. I just kept breaking things until they worked.

PipeLab is where I test ideas, break things, and occasionally ship something useful. Pipelock came out of a real problem: I was running AI agents with access to my API keys and shell, and nothing existed to stop them from leaking everything if they got compromised.

## The Lab

- On-prem K3s cluster across multiple nodes
- GPU compute for AI workloads and NVR
- Automated backups, monitoring, and security auditing
- No cloud dependencies

## Both Kinds of Infrastructure

Pipes and packets. If you need either kind fixed or secured, PipeLab handles both.

## Philosophy

Build it yourself. Understand it yourself. If it breaks, you know why. If it works, you know how.
